Files included:

https://www.python.org/doc/ - This is where I got most everything I didn't know.

Python 3 is needed to run the programs.

The program is written in python3, and the python3 shebang is there, so if you have python3 installed under the normal place '/usr/bin/', 
$ ./chatserver 
Should start the server.
and
$ ./chatclient
Should start the client.

If you have python3 installed in a different place,
$ python3 chatserver
will start the server
and 
$ python3 chatclient
will start the client.
